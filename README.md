# mad-restyles

This is a collection of forked resources that Iâ€™ve restyled into a cohesive and unique theme. Each project retains its original functionality but has been updated with a fresh look.

If you choose to use any of my restyles of the following resources, I recommend renaming them back to their original titles *(e.g., removing the "-restyle").*
